== SYNTAX ==

Brackets uses syntax heavily inspired by Common Lisp.

Functions are represented like this: (function-name argument-1 argument-2)

Code comments are put between '|' symbols.
EXAMPLE: | This is a code comment! |

== DATA ==

Byte -> 8-bit integer between 0 and 255.
EXAMPLE: 25 => 25

Array -> 1-dimensional collection of bytes indexed starting from 0.
EXAMPLE: (newarray baz 1 2 3 4 5) => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Variable -> Named byte or array accessible anywhere in your code.
EXAMPLE: (newvar foo 255) => (new variable named "foo" equal to 255)

Routine -> Named block of code that can be executed at any time.
EXAMPLE: (routine zero_foo (put 0 foo)) => (new routine named "zero_foo" that sets "foo" to 0)

Label -> Named location in the code that can be jumped to at any time.
EXAMPLE: (label bar) => (new label named "bar")
